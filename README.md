# About This Project

This is one of my practical projects to improve JavaScript skills, specifically working with intervals, time manipulation, and state management.
The goal was to create a functional tool that I can actually use in my daily routine while practicing core programming concepts.

Key learning focus: Understanding setInterval(), managing application state, and creating smooth UI updates.
